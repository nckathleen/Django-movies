## MovieLens Online database project


GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org).

My project uses the 1 million ratings data set, which includes ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. The data was released in 2003.

The project uses Python and Django and some of their libraries to read the Movielens data and look at various aspects of it.

The objective was to use the data set to practice using Django with Python.  We read in the data, created all the applicable Django files and folders, and wrote functions to give views into the data.

On the website, you will be able to see many types of information relating to the movies, the people who rated those movies, and the actual ratings given to the movie.
